# Introduction to GamutRF

GamutRF is a combination of open-source software based on the GNU radio framework and low-cost software defined radios, that together implements radio spectrum scanning, finding, and recording raw signals, with signal identification and geolocalization using a variety of machine learning approaches. GamutRF can be run on a set of Raspberry Pi4s working together in a mobile/battery powered system, can scale up to more powerful compute platforms, can offload processing to GPUs, and can support multiple radios and distributed signal finding and recording.  

At its core, the project harnesses SDR platforms that are dynamically retuned across a predefined bandwidth and collating the disparate signals into one cohesive picture, thereby achieving ultrawide spectrum awareness. By giving an ultra-wide stare at the entire usable spectrum, we are better able to understand spectrum utilization, and both common and uncommon RF transmissions. This combination of classification and localization provides numerous opportunities for better understanding the RF spectrum in both time and space. 

The signals of interest are discerned through a two-pronged approach: energy spectra analysis and RF spectrogram-based machine learning classification. The energy spectra analysis involves identifying unusual spikes or patterns in signal energy across the spectrum. This aids in quickly flagging known signals that warrant further investigation. Concurrently, the RF spectrogram-based machine learning classification brings a new dimension to signal identification. By generating and analyzing spectrograms, which represent the spectral content of a signal over time, the system employs machine learning models to classify and categorize signals. This fusion of techniques not only expedites the identification process but also ensures a comprehensive understanding of the RF environment.
